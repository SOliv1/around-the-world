## sample website

This is a codecademy front-end project focussing on use of color in web design. thereâ€™s more to creating a usable experience than just selecting beautiful, harmonious colors.

While aesthetics can enhance the display of the website, an important part of being a designer is ensuring our audience understands how to interact with our product and make effective decisions to solve their goals.

My chosen colour theme for the website can be viewed here: [Adobe-colour-themes](https://color.adobe.com/mythemes?viewTheme)

[Adobe Color CC ](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
I chose the above colour scheme complimentary.  The following are the different colour themes from which to choose.
there are multiple color schemes to select from:

* Monochromatic,
* Complementary
* Analogous
* Triadic

**IMPROVED STYLING WITH CSS**
